          The Mona Lisa is an oil painting, with a cottonwood pa nel as the
          surface. It is unusual in that most paintings are commissioned as oil
          on canvas, but the cottonwood panel is part of what has attributed to
          the fame of the painting. Because of the medium used for the image,
          the Mona Lisa has survived for six centuries without ever having been
          restored–a trait very unusual when considering the time period of the
          piece.

          He painted Starry Night in 1889 during his stay at the asylum of
          Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Blue dominates the
          painting, blending hills into the sky. The little village lays at the
          base in the painting in browns, greys, and blues. Even though each
          building is clearly outlined in black, the yellow and white of the
          stars and the moon stand out against the sky, drawing the eyes to the
          sky. They are the big attention grabber of the painting.

          His style developed from the Blue Period to the Rose Period to the
          pivotal work Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907), and the subsequent
          evolution of Cubism. Picasso’s collaboration on ballet and theatrical
          productions began in 1916. Soon thereafter, his work was characterised
          by neoclassicism and a renewed interest in drawing and figural
          representation. He was exceptionally prolific throughout his long
          lifetime. The total number of artworks he produced has been estimated
          at 50,000, comprising 1,885 paintings; 1,228 sculptures; 2,880
          ceramics, roughly 12,000 drawings, many thousands of prints, and
          numerous tapestries and rugs.

          In 1861, at the age of twenty, Monet was drafted into he First
          Regiment of African Light Cavalry. His father, despite having the
          means, declined to purchase the 2,500 franc exemption from
          conscription when Monet refused to give up painting. Monet served for
          one year in Algiers until he contracted typhoid; his aunt then stepped
          in to remove him from the army on condition that he would complete a
          formal art course. While no works from his time in Algeria survive,
          Monet later reflected that “the impressions of light and colour that I
          received there…contained the germ of my future researches
